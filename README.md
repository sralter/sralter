## More about me:
As a data professional, I employ the latest data techniques to uncover insights. I am skilled in:
* **Research**: With my science mindset, I know how to bring in external data in to enrich the analysis
* **Reporting**: My years as a researcher and consultant have taught me how to communicate effectively
* **Data Manipulation**: Need help preparing the data? I'll utilize Pandas, DuckDB, and SQL queries
* **Visualization**: Want some figures? I can use Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn), Tableau, R (ggplot2), or Excel
* **Business Intelligence Tools**: Did I mention Tableau? Let's talk about how I can build dashboards for you
* **Python for Data Analysis and Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and Jupyter are my home
* **Predictive Modeling**: Using Hyperopt and Optuna, I have tuned countless algorithms on varied datasets
* **Deep Learning**: How about neural networks? I have used Tensorflow to analyze satellite imagery
* **GIS**: Want to know "where"? I use my geospatial skills in Esri's ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, and PostGIS to solve it
* **Statistics**: Want to know "why"? I use Python's Statsmodels to figure that out
* **Natural Language Processing**: I am skilled in NLP and can help you perform text or sentiment analysis
